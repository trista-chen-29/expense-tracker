# Product Principles

## Core Problem
Tracking expenses often fails not because tools are missing, but because logging an expense interrupts daily flow and requires too much thinking.

## Primary Goal
Reduce friction in expense tracking so that recording an expense can be done in under 5 seconds.

## Design Priorities
- Optimize for speed and minimal input over feature richness.
- Use sensible defaults to reduce cognitive load.
- Prefer human-in-the-loop automation over fully automatic actions.
- Design for real daily usage, not demo or showcase scenarios.

## Non-Goals
- Building a full personal finance platform.
- Advanced budgeting, forecasting, or investment tracking.
- Fully automatic bank integrations without user confirmation.

## Success Metric
A user can consistently log expenses with minimal effort and without breaking their daily routine.
