## 🎯 Design Goal
The main goal of this project is to reduce the friction of expense tracking.
Many people stop tracking not because tools are missing, but because logging an expense is slow and interrupts daily flow.
This app prioritizes fast input, sensible defaults, and human-in-the-loop automation over feature complexity.

## 🧠 Motivation
I built this because I often forget to track expenses. My bank notifications remind me that I spent money, but I still don’t log it because traditional trackers feel too slow.
This project explores a faster, low-friction workflow that makes logging expenses easy enough to become a daily habit.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development
AI tools may be used for boilerplate and suggestions. All logic, data modeling decisions, and debugging are reviewed and validated manually.
