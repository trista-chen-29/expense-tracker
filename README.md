## 🧠 Motivation
I built this project to solve a personal problem: 
  I often forgot to track my expenses and wanted a faster, simpler way to understand where my money goes. The goal was to design an application that is easy to use, quick to log expenses, and practical enough to become part of a daily routine, while also gaining hands-on experience with full-stack development, authentication, data modeling, and deployment.
